## Limitations

- **PDF Bank Statement Parsing (AI/LLM Accuracy)**  
  Currently, tabular statement PDFs are sent to Gemini pro-vision for parsing. While the UI, upload, and API routing are complete, Gemini's return format is sometimes inconsistent and causes JSON parsing issues. This feature is being actively refined and integrated.

- **OCR Limitations (Image Receipts)**  
  Poor-quality or stylized receipts may produce inconsistent or incomplete data from AI models.

- **Deployment-Ready Setup**  
  Configuration for production deployment (e.g., Vercel, Railway, Render) is not included but easily adjustable.
