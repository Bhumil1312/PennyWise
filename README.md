## Development & Run Commands

You’ll need multiple terminals to run everything locally.

### 1. Run the main app
```
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run Inngest Dev Server (for email triggers & background jobs)
```
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

make sure your '/api/inngest' source is working

> ⚠️ If you don’t have `inngest-cli` installed:
> ```
> npm install -g inngest-cli
> ```

### 3. Run Email Testing Tool (like MailDev or any SMTP dev server)
```
npm run email
```

This enables you to test triggered emails (e.g., 80% budget warning).

## Limitations

- **Generative AI Output Variability**
  The structured transaction data extracted via Gemini AI from document images or other sources can sometimes be inconsistent or incomplete. Continual improvements are underway to enhance parsing accuracy and format consistency.

- **Edge Case Accuracy (OCR and Interpretation)**
  Receipts or statements with faded text, complex layouts, or unusual fonts may cause the AI to misinterpret details, leading to partial or incorrect transaction data.

- **Local Development Focus**
  This project is built assuming a local development environment. Additional configuration and optimization is needed for smooth deployment on production platforms like Vercel or Render.
