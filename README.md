## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A PostgreSQL database
- Gemini API Key
- Clerk project/API keys
- SMTP credentials (for alerts)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Bhumil1312/PennyWise.git
    cd PennyWise
    npm install
    ```

2. Copy environment configuration:
    ```
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

3. Set environment variables in `.env.local`:
    - `DATABASE_URL`
    - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
    - `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    - `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API` (optional)

4. Set up Prisma DB:

## Development & Run Commands

You’ll need multiple terminals to run everything locally.

### 1. Run the main app
```
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run Inngest Dev Server (for email triggers & background jobs)
```
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

make sure your '/api/inngest' source is working

> ⚠️ If you don’t have `inngest-cli` installed:
> ```
> npm install -g inngest-cli
> ```

### 3. Run Email Testing Tool (like MailDev or any SMTP dev server)
```
npm run email
```

This enables you to test triggered emails (e.g., 80% budget warning).

## Git Workflow Instructions

To work on custom features or collaborate:

### Create & Switch to a Branch:

## Limitations

- **PDF Parser Still Evolving**  
  Gemini AI output from PDF tables can be inconsistent. I'm working on structuring the response into clean transaction arrays.

- **Edge Case Accuracy (OCR)**  
  Faded or skewed receipts sometimes confuse Gemini’s OCR, resulting in partially incorrect data.

- **Live Hosting Option**  
  This README assumes local dev setup. A production-ready deployment config (e.g., Vercel or Render) can be added easily.
